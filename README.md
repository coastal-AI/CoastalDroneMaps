# Coastal Drone Maps

**Coastal Drone Maps** is a collaborative platform developed by a network of institutions commited to mapping coastal habitats using drone technology. Its primary goal is to provide clear overview of areas where drone surveys have already been conducted, fostering collaboration, optimizing resources, and minimizing redundant efforts.

## Viewer
This collaborative viewer displays metadata from photogrammetric drone surveys of coastal environments. The metadata primarily includes flight location, date, authorship, contact information, and other relevant details. Where available, low-resolution previews of resulting orthomosaics are provided for reference. Full-resolution orthomosaics are not distributed through this platform.

All metadata and low-resolution previews are shared under the [CC BY-NC 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.en). Contributing institutions retain full ownership and control over the original orthomosaics and may define their own licensing terms. For questions about specific flights or datasets, please contact the respective authors listed in the metadata.
