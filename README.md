# Coastal Drone Maps

Coastal Drone Maps is a collaborative platform developed by several institutions dedicated to mapping coastal habitats using drone technology. Its main objective is to provide clear insights into areas where drone surveys have already been carried out, fostering collaboration, optimizing resources, and minimizing redundant efforts.

## Viewer
This collaborative viewer presents information from photogrammetric drone surveys, allowing users to explore flight dates, spatial coverage, and other relevant metadata. Previews of orthomosaics generated from these flights are available for reference; however, the full-resolution orthomosaics are not publicly accessible through this platform. To request access to orthomosaics, please contact the designated representative.

All metadata and orthomosaic previews are shared under the [CC BY-NC 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.en). Contributing institutions retain full control over access to the complete orthomosaics and may apply their own licensing terms.
